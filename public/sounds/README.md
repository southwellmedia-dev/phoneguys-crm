## Files

- `notification.mp3` - Placeholder for notification sound (currently empty)

To add an actual notification sound:
1. Replace the empty notification.mp3 file with your desired sound
2. Keep the file size small (< 100KB recommended)
3. Use a format compatible with web browsers (MP3, OGG, or WAV)
