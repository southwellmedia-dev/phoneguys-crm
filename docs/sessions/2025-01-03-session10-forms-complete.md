# Session 10: Order & Customer Forms Complete
**Date**: January 3, 2025  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Completing Add/Edit forms for Orders and Customers

## Session Objectives
1. Fix form validation issues preventing order submission
2. Complete Edit Order functionality
3. Build Add Customer form
4. Build Edit Customer form
5. Fix database schema issues

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Order Form Validation Issues ✅
- **Issue**: Form validation was failing silently due to schema mismatches
- **Solutions**:
  - Fixed device_brand validation to accept any string (not just enum)
  - Removed customer_id from edit form (customers shouldn't be changed after order creation)
  - Fixed status value case sensitivity (uppercase "NEW" vs lowercase "new")
  - Added missing `deposit_amount` column to database
  - Fixed `created_by` field that doesn't exist in schema

### 2. Edit Order Form Completed ✅
- **Features**:
  - Full order editing with proper pre-population
  - Customer info displayed but not editable (business logic)
  - Device selection with automatic brand/model population
  - Status and priority management
  - Cost tracking (estimated, actual, deposit)
  - Estimated completion date/time
  
- **UI Improvements**:
  - Uses PageContainer wrapper for consistent layout
  - Proper header with action buttons
  - Toast notifications using Sonner
  - Form validation with clear error messages

### 3. Add Customer Form ✅
- **Location**: `/customers/new`
- **Features**:
  - Basic information (name, email, phone)
  - Optional address fields (street, city, state, zip)
  - Internal notes field
  - Form validation using Zod
  - Success redirect to customer detail page

### 4. Edit Customer Form ✅
- **Location**: `/customers/[id]/edit`
- **Features**:
  - All customer fields editable
  - Customer statistics display (total orders, total spent, customer since)
  - Proper form pre-population
  - Success redirect back to customer detail

### 5. Database Schema Fixes ✅
- **Added to repair_tickets table**:
  - `deposit_amount` column (NUMERIC 10,2)
  
- **Added to customers table**:
  - `address` (TEXT)
  - `city` (TEXT)
  - `state` (TEXT)
  - `zip_code` (TEXT)
  - `notes` (TEXT)
  - `total_orders` (INTEGER, default 0)
  - `total_spent` (NUMERIC 10,2, default 0)
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN, default true)

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Toast Import Errors
- **Problem**: Code was importing non-existent `@/hooks/use-toast`
- **Solution**: Fixed to use `import { toast } from 'sonner'` throughout

### 2. Next.js 15 Async Params
- **Problem**: Route params need to be awaited in Next.js 15
- **Solution**: Updated all dynamic routes to use `params: Promise<{id: string}>` and await them

### 3. Server Component Props
- **Problem**: Can't pass onClick handlers from Server to Client Components
- **Solution**: Replaced onClick with href for server-side rendered buttons

### 4. Form Validation Debugging
- **Problem**: Forms weren't submitting with no visible errors
- **Solution**: Added extensive console logging to identify validation issues

### 5. PageHeader vs PageContainer
- **Problem**: Inconsistent component usage across forms
- **Solution**: Standardized on PageContainer for all forms

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Consistent UI Patterns
- All forms now use PageContainer wrapper
- Action buttons in header follow same pattern
- Toast notifications standardized with Sonner

### 2. Form Validation
- Comprehensive Zod schemas
- Proper error handling and display
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### 3. Database Integrity
- Added missing columns properly
- Maintained referential integrity
- Used appropriate data types and defaults
