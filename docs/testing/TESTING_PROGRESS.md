## 🚧 Blockers & Challenges

### Current Blockers
- None (starting phase)

### Anticipated Challenges
1. **Database Setup**: Local Supabase test configuration
2. **Real-time Mocking**: WebSocket subscription testing
3. **Auth Context**: React authentication provider testing
4. **Timer Mocking**: Time-dependent functionality
5. **Integration Complexity**: Cross-service interactions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use local Supabase instance for integration tests
- Mock RealtimeService at the service level
- Create test wrapper components for auth context
- Use Jest fake timers for time-dependent tests
- Focus on behavior testing over implementation details
