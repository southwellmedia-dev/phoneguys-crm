```tsx
import { 
  ButtonPremium, 
  MetricCard, 
  StatusBadge,
  MetricCardLive,
  RecentActivityLive,
  TablePremiumLive
} from '@/components/premium';

// Static UI components
<ButtonPremium variant="gradient" size="lg">
  Get Started
</ButtonPremium>

<MetricCard
  title="Total Revenue"
  value="$12,345"
  change={15.3}
  trend="up"
  variant="success"
/>

// Connected components with real-time data
<MetricCardLive
  metric="total_tickets"
  variant="primary"
  showSparkline
  size="lg"
/>

<RecentActivityLive 
  title="Recent Activity"
  limit={10}
  showTabs
/>

<TablePremiumLive

    { key: 'ticket_number', label: 'Order #', sortable: true },
    { key: 'customer_name', label: 'Customer', sortable: true },
    { key: 'status', label: 'Status' }
  ]}
  clickable
  basePath="/orders"
/>
```

### Adding New Components

1. Create component file in appropriate category folder
2. Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
3. Export from category index file
4. Export from main index file
5. Add to showcase page
6. Update this README

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important elements should stand out without being overwhelming
2. **Consistency**: Similar patterns for similar problems across the system
3. **Feedback**: Every action should have immediate visual feedback
4. **Performance**: Smooth animations, no janky transitions
5. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly
6. **Flexibility**: Components should be composable and extensible

### Design Language
- **Fintech-Inspired**: Clean, professional aesthetic similar to Stripe, Linear, and Revolut
- **Flat Design**: Minimal use of shadows, focus on borders and subtle backgrounds
- **Strategic Color**: Primary cyan (#0094CA) used sparingly for maximum impact
- **Consistent Pills**: All status badges use rounded-full for uniform appearance
- **Inverted Variants**: Solid backgrounds with proper text color contrast for CTAs

### Dashboard Layout
- **Masonry Grid**: Asymmetric 6-column layout with varying card sizes
- **Primary Focus**: New Tickets with inverted-primary (solid cyan) background
- **Visual Balance**: Mix of bordered, accent, and inverted variants
- **Clickable Rows**: All table rows navigate to detail views on click
- **Service Pills**: Services displayed as cyan-colored badge pills
