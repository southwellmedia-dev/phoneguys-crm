# Session 15: Remote Deployment & Database Migration
**Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Duration**: ~4 hours  
**Focus**: Migrate local development to remote Supabase production environment and device image migration

## üéØ Session Overview
This session focused on transitioning from local development to remote production deployment. The primary goal was to migrate all local database schema, data, and configurations to the remote Supabase instance, followed by migrating device images to Supabase Storage. While database migration was successful, device image migration encountered issues that require further investigation.

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Development Server Issues Resolution
- **EPERM Permission Errors**: Resolved `.next` directory permission issues preventing development server startup
- **Solution**: Cleared `.next` directory completely using `rm -rf .next`
- **Result**: Development server started successfully with Turbopack

### 2. Environment Configuration Migration
- **Switched from Local to Remote**: Updated `.env.local` to use production Supabase URLs
- **Service Role Key Update**: Configured remote service role key for admin operations
- **Configuration Changes**:
  ```bash
  # From local development URLs
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
  # To production URLs  
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://egotypldqzdzjclikmeg.supabase.co
  ```

### 3. Database Schema & Data Migration
- **Complete Migration Success**: Used Supabase CLI to push all local schema and data to remote
- **Command Used**: `npx supabase db push --password "iZPi-8JYjn?0KtvY"`
- **Migration Fixes Applied**:
  - Fixed constraint violations in ticket_notes table by updating existing data
  - Resolved services table duplicate key errors with ON CONFLICT clauses
  - Corrected hooks sequence issues in seed data
  - Fixed variable name collisions in stored procedures

### 4. Seed Data Application
- **Comprehensive Data Transfer**: Successfully applied all seed data including:
  - User accounts and profiles
  - Customers and contact information
  - Repair tickets with full status history
  - Device manufacturers and models
  - Service categories and pricing
  - Time tracking entries
- **Data Integrity**: All foreign key relationships maintained correctly

### 5. Migration Script Execution Attempt
- **Script Run**: Executed device image migration script against remote database
- **Issues Identified**: Script reported success but images not actually uploaded
- **Debugging Started**: Initial investigation revealed upload process failures

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### Database Migration Constraints
```sql
-- Fixed existing ticket_notes data before applying constraint
UPDATE ticket_notes 
SET note_type = 'internal' 
WHERE note_type IS NULL OR note_type NOT IN ('internal', 'customer', 'system');

-- Added conflict resolution to services insert
INSERT INTO "public"."services" (...) VALUES (...) 
ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING;
```

### Variable Name Collision Fix
```sql
-- Changed conflicting variable names in stored procedure
DECLARE
    repair_record RECORD;
    temp_manufacturer_id UUID;  -- Changed from manufacturer_id
    temp_model_id UUID;         -- Changed from model_id
```

### Sequence Error Resolution
```sql
-- Commented out problematic hooks sequence line
-- SELECT pg_catalog.setval('"supabase_functions"."hooks_id_seq"', 1, false);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

### 1. Device Image Migration Script Problems
- **Symptom**: Script claims successful upload of 15+ images but only 1 test file appears in remote storage
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Database update operations failing silently
  - Image file path resolution issues
  - Supabase Storage authentication problems
  - Logic flaws in file matching algorithm

### 2. Migration Script Logic Issues
- **Device Skipping**: Script incorrectly skips devices thinking they already have Supabase URLs
- **File Matching**: Complex filename matching patterns may not align with actual file structure
- **Error Handling**: Silent failures preventing proper error reporting

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Environment Switching Pattern
- Established clear separation between local development and production configurations
- Service role keys properly configured for admin operations
- Database passwords securely managed for CLI operations

### Migration Workflow
- Supabase CLI as primary tool for database operations
- Systematic approach to constraint violation resolution
- ON CONFLICT strategies for handling duplicate data

## üìä Current Status

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Local to remote environment migration
- Complete database schema migration
- Full seed data application
- Development environment configured for production

### In Progress üîÑ
- Device image migration debugging
- Identifying root cause of upload failures
- Verifying remote storage bucket configuration

### Pending ‚è≥
- Fix device image migration script logic
- Verify all device images uploaded correctly
- Test end-to-end application functionality on remote database

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Debug Device Image Migration**:
   - Investigate why uploads appear successful but files don't persist
   - Check Supabase Storage bucket permissions and authentication
   - Review migration script error handling and database update logic

2. **Verify Remote Deployment**:
   - Test all application features against remote database
   - Confirm authentication flows work with remote Supabase
   - Validate API endpoints function correctly

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Complete device image migration
   - Perform end-to-end testing
   - Update deployment documentation

## üìù Key Commands Used

```bash
# Clear development server cache
rm -rf .next

# Database migration to remote
npx supabase db push --password "iZPi-8JYjn?0KtvY"

# Device image migration attempt
npx tsx scripts/migrate-device-images.ts

# Development server with Turbopack
npm run dev --turbopack
```

## üîç Files Modified

- `.env.local` - Updated to remote Supabase configuration
- `supabase/migrations/20250903145811_make_ticket_notes_user_nullable.sql` - Added data fix
- `supabase/migrations/20250903215214_device_management.sql` - Fixed variable naming
- `supabase/seed.sql` - Resolved conflicts and sequence issues
- `docs/project-checklist.md` - Updated with Phase 12 completion

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **CLI-First Approach**: Supabase CLI provides the most reliable method for database migrations
2. **Constraint Resolution**: Always fix existing data before applying new constraints
3. **Conflict Handling**: Use ON CONFLICT clauses proactively for idempotent migrations  
4. **Environment Separation**: Clear environment configuration prevents deployment issues
5. **Script Validation**: Always verify migration script results against actual storage/database state

This session successfully established the remote production environment and migrated all database components. The remaining device image migration issue requires focused debugging to complete the deployment process.
