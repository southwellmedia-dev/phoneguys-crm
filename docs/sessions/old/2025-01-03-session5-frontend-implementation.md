## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **Authentication Redirect Issue**: Fixed login redirecting to starter page instead of dashboard

## 🔄 Architecture Decisions

1. **Route Groups**: Used `(dashboard)` route group for protected CRM pages

## 💡 Notes for Next Session

1. **Customer Management**: Build customer list and detail pages
2. **Forms**: Implement order creation and editing forms
3. **Timer Integration**: Connect timer UI to API endpoints
4. **Reports**: Create reporting dashboard
5. **Settings**: Build user and system settings pages
6. **Email Templates**: Design and implement notification templates
7. **Performance**: Add loading states and optimize queries
8. **Testing**: Begin writing component and integration tests

## 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **Component Architecture**: Mixing server and client components requires careful planning
2. **RLS Complexity**: Row Level Security needs proper policies before enabling
3. **Supabase Auth**: Separate from database users table - need both for full functionality
4. **Design Tokens**: CSS variables provide excellent theming flexibility
5. **User Experience**: Small details like timer animation make big difference
