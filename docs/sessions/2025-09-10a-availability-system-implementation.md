# Session: Availability System Implementation
**Date**: January 10, 2025
**Focus**: Fixing website integration form date/time selection

## Problem Statement
The website integration form's schedule step (step 3) doesn't allow date/time selection. The availability API returns empty data because appointment slots aren't being generated.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Settings Page Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive settings page for business hours, appointment settings, and store settings
   - Follows proper repository → service → hook → component architecture
   - Uses HeaderWrapperPremium to match dashboard/appointments pages
   - Implements proper hydration strategy with hasLoadedOnce pattern

2. **Business Hours Configuration**
   - Business hours table has data (Mon-Fri 9AM-6PM, Sat 10AM-4PM, Sun closed)
   - Settings page allows editing business hours
   - Data persists in remote database

3. **Repository Fixes**
   - Fixed AvailabilityRepository to use `await this.getClient()` instead of direct `this.supabase`
   - Fixed critical methods: getBusinessHours, getAllBusinessHours, getSpecialDate, getAvailableSlots
   - Removed incorrect supabase property caching attempt

### ✅ Appointment Slot Generation
1. **Database Functions Created**
   - Created `generate_appointment_slots` function for single date
   - Created `generate_appointment_slots_range` function for date ranges
   - Created `get_available_slots` function with formatted times
   - Created `has_appointment_slots` helper function

2. **Slots Generated Successfully**
   - 30-minute slots by default (configurable)
   - Respects business hours and lunch breaks
   - Generated for next 30 days automatically
   - 16 slots on weekdays, 12 on Saturdays, 0 on Sundays

### ❌ Issues Found
1. **Direct Supabase Calls**: Was making direct calls instead of using repository pattern
2. **Missing Slot Generation**: The generate_appointment_slots database function doesn't exist
3. **Empty Availability Response**: API returns empty array because no slots are generated

## Architecture Decisions

### Slot Generation Strategy
1. **Default Interval**: 30 minutes (configurable via appointment_settings)
2. **Generation Timing**: Generate slots on-demand when requested (lazy generation)
3. **Storage**: Store in appointment_slots table with:
   - date, start_time, end_time
   - is_available flag
   - staff_id (null for general availability)
   - max_capacity (default 1)

### Implementation Plan
1. Create slot generation logic in AvailabilityRepository
2. Generate slots based on business hours
3. Handle break times (12:00-13:00 lunch break)
4. Return slots via the availability API
5. Test with website integration form

## Code Changes

### Fixed Files
- `lib/repositories/availability.repository.ts` - Fixed to use proper client pattern
- `lib/services/availability.service.ts` - Removed incorrect initialization
- `app/admin/layout.tsx` - Updated to use HeaderWrapperPremium
- `app/admin/settings/settings-client.tsx` - Follows appointments page pattern

### Files to Create/Update
- Need to implement proper slot generation in repository
- Update availability service to generate slots when none exist
- Ensure form can consume the data properly

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Business hours are configured ✅
- [ ] Appointment slots are generated
- [ ] Availability API returns slots
- [ ] Form displays available dates
- [ ] Form allows time selection
- [ ] Form submission works

## Next Steps
1. Implement slot generation logic
2. Test with form preview
3. Ensure data flows properly through the system

## Notes
- Using remote database (not local)
- Following repository → service → hook → component pattern
- Must avoid direct Supabase calls
- Use proper error handling and logging
