### 5. Access Control & Data Integrity

#### Completed Tickets (Selective Locking)
**Locked Fields:**
- Status changes (except reopening)
- Service modifications
- Time entries
- Device information
- Issue descriptions

**Editable Fields:**
- Internal notes
- Customer notes
- Photos
- Payment information

#### Converted Appointments (Full Locking)
- Completely read-only
- Clear visual warning banner

- ✅ Filter shows only tickets assigned to current user
- ✅ Visual feedback with button state changes
- ✅ Extended DataTable component to support custom toolbar actions
- ✅ Fixed API route to properly handle assignedTo filtering
- ✅ Resolved user ID mapping issues for consistent filtering

#### Technical Implementation:
1. **Client-side filtering**
   - Added `showMyTickets` state management
   - Fetch current user ID using `getCurrentUserInfo`
   - Pass filters to `useTickets` hook
   
2. **API Updates**
   - Added `assignedTo` query parameter support
   - Fixed repository method calls (`findPaginated` vs `findAll`)
   - Used `findByAssignee` for user-specific queries
   
3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Toggle button with User/Users icons
   - Dynamic stats card updates
   - Loading state while fetching user ID

### 7. Bug Fixes & Improvements (Session 2)

#### Repository Instance Caching Issues (Session 3):
1. **Error: "this.noteRepo.createNote is not a function"**
   - Occurred when changing ticket status to complete in production
   - Root cause: Stale repository instance or module caching issue
   - Solution: Restarting the dev server cleared cached instances
   - No code changes required - issue was environment-related

2. **Error: "e.findByEmail is not a function"**
   - Occurred when inviting users in production
   - Root cause: Direct repository instantiation instead of using singleton manager
   - Fix: Updated UserService to use `getRepository.users()` instead of `new UserRepository()`

3. **Error: 405 Method Not Allowed on appointment assignment**
   - Occurred when trying to assign appointments
   - Root cause: Missing PATCH handler in `/api/appointments/[id]/route.ts`
   - Fix: Created complete appointment API route with GET, PATCH, DELETE handlers
   - Added proper validation to prevent reassignment of converted/cancelled appointments

4. **Service Repository Pattern Updates**
   - Updated `UserService` to use repository manager singleton
   - Updated `CustomerService` to use repository manager singleton
   - Updated `AppointmentService` to use repository manager singleton
   - This ensures consistent repository instance management across the application

### 8. Additional Bug Fixes

#### Assignment Bug Fix:
1. **PATCH Handler Missing**
   - Added PATCH method to `/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`
   - Handles assignment updates specifically
   - Prevents reassignment of completed/cancelled tickets

#### Statistics Population Issues:
1. **Production Database Statistics**
   - Created multiple migrations to populate user statistics
   - Fixed column name mismatches (is_internal → note_type, scheduled_at → scheduled_date/time)
   - Properly assigned historical data to users
   - Created data population scripts for production

2. **User ID Mapping Issues**
   - Identified root cause: auth user ID vs app user ID mapping
   - API already handles mapping correctly via `requireAuth`
   - Client-side uses `getCurrentUserInfo` for consistent ID mapping
   - Debug endpoint created at `/api/debug/user` for troubleshooting

#### Database Issues Fixed:
1. **RLS Policy Violations** (`20250906180000_fix_user_activity_rls_policies.sql`)
   - Added proper INSERT policies for activity logging

2. **Missing Columns** (`20250906181000_add_scheduled_for_to_notifications.sql`)
   - Added scheduled_for column to notifications table

3. **Notification Constraints** (`20250906183000_fix_notification_types.sql`)
   - Updated allowed notification types

4. **Statistics Calculation** (`20250906185000_fix_avg_completion_time_calculation.sql`)
   - Fixed to use actual logged time instead of elapsed time
   - More accurate work time representation

5. **UI Component Errors**
   - Fixed Select component empty string value issue
   - Changed to use "unassigned" as the value

## 📊 What the System Now Tracks

### User Metrics:
- **Tickets:** Created, Assigned, Completed, In Progress, Cancelled, On Hold
- **Appointments:** Created, Assigned, Converted, No-shows, Cancelled  
- **Notes:** Total created by user
- **Time:** Total time logged, average completion time (actual work time)
- **Activity:** All user actions with timestamps and details
- **Performance:** All-time statistics, productivity scores, efficiency metrics

### Assignment Features:
- Track who created each ticket/appointment
- Track who is assigned to each item
- Track who converted appointments to tickets
- Maintain assignment history for completed work
- Prevent stats manipulation through reassignment

## 🎯 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Statistics Calculation
- **Decision:** Use all-time statistics instead of date-filtered periods
- **Rationale:** Simpler implementation, consistent metrics, better performance
- **Result:** Clear, accurate representation of overall performance

### 2. Assignment Restrictions
- **Decision:** Disable reassignment for final states
- **Rationale:** Maintains data integrity and accurate performance metrics
- **Result:** Fair attribution of work, accurate statistics

### 3. Average Time Calculation
- **Decision:** Use actual logged time, not elapsed calendar time
- **Rationale:** Tickets may wait for parts, approvals, etc.
- **Result:** True representation of work effort

### 4. Access Control Pattern
- **Decision:** Selective locking for completed, full locking for converted
- **Rationale:** Balance between data integrity and practical needs
- **Result:** Maintains accuracy while allowing necessary updates

## 🔧 Session 5: Appointments List Enhancements

### Issues Addressed:
1. **Appointment Filtering & Organization**
   - Replaced "Hide Converted" toggle with dedicated "Converted" tab
   - Added comprehensive status filtering (Scheduled, Confirmed, Arrived, etc.)
   - Implemented date-based tabs (Upcoming, Today, Past, Converted, Cancelled, All Active)
   - Added sorting by appointment date/time (Soonest First / Latest First)

2. **Date Display Bug Fix**
   - Fixed incorrect "Today" display for tomorrow's appointments
   - Root cause: JavaScript Date parsing treated YYYY-MM-DD as UTC
   - Solution: Manual date parsing to ensure local timezone consistency
   - Now correctly shows "Today" only for current day appointments

3. **UI Layout Improvements**
   - Moved columns selector to header alongside other controls
   - Changed sort button to Select dropdown for consistent sizing
   - Moved search bar inline with tabs for better space utilization
   - Added search icon for visual clarity
   - All controls now have uniform height (h-9) and styling

### Technical Implementation:
1. **Filter Logic Updates:**
   ```typescript
   // Parse dates correctly for local timezone
   const [year, month, day] = apt.scheduled_date.split('-');
   const aptDate = new Date(parseInt(year), parseInt(month) - 1, parseInt(day));
   ```

2. **Tab-Based Filtering:**
   - Converted appointments only shown in dedicated tab
   - All other tabs automatically exclude converted items
   - Status filter hidden on Converted/Cancelled tabs (redundant)

3. **Search Functionality:**
   - Searches across customer name, phone, email, appointment number
   - Integrated with other filters (compound filtering)

### Results:
- ✅ Clean separation of converted appointments from active workflow
- ✅ Accurate date displays and filtering
- ✅ Improved UI organization and consistency
- ✅ Better user experience with intuitive controls

## 🔧 Session 6: My Appointments Filter Implementation

### Features Added:
1. **My Appointments Toggle**
   - Added toggle button to filter appointments by current user
   - Shows "My Appointments" vs "All Appointments" with clear visual states
   - Uses UserCheck/Users icons to indicate active filter
   - Positioned alongside search bar for easy access

2. **User-Specific Filtering**
   - Integrated with existing appointment assignment system
   - Fetches current user ID using `getCurrentUserInfo` utility
   - Filters by `assigned_to` field when toggle is active
   - Works with all other filters (tabs, status, search) simultaneously

3. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed import path: `@/lib/utils/user` → `@/lib/utils/user-mapping`
   - Added Supabase client parameter to `getCurrentUserInfo` function
   - Proper null handling for user info retrieval

### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Fetch current user ID
const supabase = createClient();
const userInfo = await getCurrentUserInfo(supabase);
setCurrentUserId(userInfo.appUserId);

// Filter appointments
if (showMyAppointments && currentUserId) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(apt => apt.assigned_to === currentUserId);
}
```

### Results:
- ✅ Users can quickly filter to see only their assigned appointments
- ✅ Consistent implementation with "My Tickets" feature
- ✅ Visual feedback shows when personal filter is active
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing filter system
