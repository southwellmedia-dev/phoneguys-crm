- ‚úÖ Created API endpoints:
  - `/api/users/[id]/profile` - Get user profile with statistics
  - `/api/orders` - Enhanced with created_by and assigned_to tracking
  - `/api/appointments` - Enhanced with assignment capabilities

### 3. User Profile Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Created user profile page at `/profile`
- ‚úÖ Built profile UI components:
  - Statistics cards showing all-time metrics
  - Performance indicators
  - Recent activity feed
  - Workload distribution
- ‚úÖ Fixed user ID mapping between auth and app users
- ‚úÖ Changed greeting from "Good Morning" to simple "Hi, [Name]"

### 4. User Assignment System
**Implemented comprehensive assignment capabilities:**

#### Ticket Assignment
- ‚úÖ Added assignment dropdown to ticket detail view
- ‚úÖ Added assignment field to ticket creation form
- ‚úÖ Disabled reassignment for completed/cancelled tickets
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators for locked states

#### Appointment Assignment
- ‚úÖ Added assignment dropdown to appointment detail view
- ‚úÖ Added assignment field to appointment creation form
- ‚úÖ Disabled reassignment for converted/cancelled/no-show appointments
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators for locked states

### 5. Access Control & Data Integrity

#### Completed Tickets (Selective Locking)
**Locked Fields:**
- Status changes (except reopening)
- Service modifications
- Time entries
- Device information
- Issue descriptions

**Editable Fields:**
- Internal notes
- Customer notes
- Photos
- Payment information

#### Converted Appointments (Full Locking)
- Completely read-only
- Clear visual warning banner
- Link to view created ticket
- All editing disabled

### 6. Bug Fixes & Improvements

#### Database Issues Fixed:
1. **RLS Policy Violations** (`20250906180000_fix_user_activity_rls_policies.sql`)
   - Added proper INSERT policies for activity logging

2. **Missing Columns** (`20250906181000_add_scheduled_for_to_notifications.sql`)
   - Added scheduled_for column to notifications table

3. **Notification Constraints** (`20250906183000_fix_notification_types.sql`)
   - Updated allowed notification types

4. **Statistics Calculation** (`20250906185000_fix_avg_completion_time_calculation.sql`)
   - Fixed to use actual logged time instead of elapsed time
   - More accurate work time representation

5. **UI Component Errors**
   - Fixed Select component empty string value issue
   - Changed to use "unassigned" as the value

## üìä What the System Now Tracks

### User Metrics:
- **Tickets:** Created, Assigned, Completed, In Progress, Cancelled, On Hold
- **Appointments:** Created, Assigned, Converted, No-shows, Cancelled  
- **Notes:** Total created by user
- **Time:** Total time logged, average completion time (actual work time)
- **Activity:** All user actions with timestamps and details
- **Performance:** All-time statistics, productivity scores, efficiency metrics

### Assignment Features:
- Track who created each ticket/appointment
- Track who is assigned to each item
- Track who converted appointments to tickets
- Maintain assignment history for completed work
- Prevent stats manipulation through reassignment

## üéØ Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Statistics Calculation
- **Decision:** Use all-time statistics instead of date-filtered periods
- **Rationale:** Simpler implementation, consistent metrics, better performance
- **Result:** Clear, accurate representation of overall performance

### 2. Assignment Restrictions
- **Decision:** Disable reassignment for final states
- **Rationale:** Maintains data integrity and accurate performance metrics
- **Result:** Fair attribution of work, accurate statistics

### 3. Average Time Calculation
- **Decision:** Use actual logged time, not elapsed calendar time
- **Rationale:** Tickets may wait for parts, approvals, etc.
- **Result:** True representation of work effort

### 4. Access Control Pattern
- **Decision:** Selective locking for completed, full locking for converted
- **Rationale:** Balance between data integrity and practical needs
- **Result:** Maintains accuracy while allowing necessary updates

## üöÄ Ready for Production
