### Component Principles

1. **Consistency First**
   - Use existing components before creating new ones
   - Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and interactions
   - Follow established patterns for similar functionalities

2. **Composition Over Customization**
   - Build complex UIs from simple, reusable components
   - Prefer props and variants over one-off modifications
   - Keep components focused on single responsibilities

3. **Accessibility Built-In**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader friendly
   - Color contrast ratios maintained
   - Focus states clearly visible

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 0 - 639px (base)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1023px
- **Desktop**: 1024px - 1279px
- **Large Desktop**: 1280px+

### Responsive Principles
1. **Mobile-First Development**
   - Start with mobile layout
   - Enhance for larger screens
   - Touch interactions primary

2. **Content Priority**
   - Most important information visible first
   - Progressive disclosure for details
   - Collapsible sections on mobile

3. **Flexible Grids**
   - 12-column grid system
   - Fluid containers with max-widths
   - Responsive spacing scale

## Theme System

### Theme Structure
```typescript
interface Theme {
  colors: {
    brand: BrandColors;
    semantic: SemanticColors;
    neutral: NeutralColors;
    status: StatusColors;
  };
  typography: TypographyScale;
  spacing: SpacingScale;
  breakpoints: Breakpoints;
  shadows: ShadowScale;
  animations: AnimationTokens;
}
```

### Theme Modes
1. **Light Mode** (Default)
   - White backgrounds
   - Dark text for contrast
   - Cyan primary actions
   - Subtle shadows

2. **Dark Mode**
   - Dark navy backgrounds
   - Light text for readability
   - Adjusted cyan for visibility
   - Elevated surfaces with subtle borders

### Theme Customization
- CSS variables for runtime theming
- TypeScript constants for type safety
- Tailwind configuration for utility classes
- Component variants for different contexts

## Motion & Animation

### Animation Principles
1. **Purposeful** - Every animation has a clear function
2. **Fast** - 200-300ms for most transitions
3. **Smooth** - Use easing functions (ease-out preferred)
4. **Subtle** - Enhance, don't distract

### Standard Animations
- **Page transitions**: 200ms fade
- **Hover states**: 150ms all properties
- **Loading states**: Continuous subtle pulse
- **Success feedback**: 300ms scale + fade
- **Error shake**: 200ms horizontal shake

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Color Contrast**
  - Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum
  - Large text: 3:1 minimum
  - Interactive elements: 3:1 minimum

- **Keyboard Navigation**
  - All interactive elements keyboard accessible
  - Logical tab order
  - Skip links for navigation
  - Focus trapping in modals

- **Screen Readers**
  - Semantic HTML structure
  - ARIA labels where needed
  - Live regions for dynamic content
  - Descriptive link text

### Inclusive Design
- **Multiple input methods** supported
- **Error prevention** over error correction
- **Clear feedback** for all actions
- **Flexible text sizing** (rem units)
- **High contrast mode** support

## Design Token Categories

### 1. Color Tokens
- Brand colors (primary, accent)
- Semantic colors (success, warning, error, info)
- Neutral palette (grays)
- Status colors (repair states)

### 2. Typography Tokens
- Font families
- Font sizes
- Font weights
- Line heights
- Letter spacing

### 3. Spacing Tokens
- Base unit (4px)
- Scale multipliers
- Component padding
- Layout margins

### 4. Effect Tokens
- Border radius
- Shadow depths
- Opacity levels
- Blur amounts

### 5. Animation Tokens
- Duration scales
- Easing functions
- Delay values

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Use the design system first** - Don't create custom styles
2. **Follow the token hierarchy** - Semantic > Component > Primitive
3. **Maintain consistency** - Same patterns for similar problems
4. **Test responsively** - Check all breakpoints
5. **Validate accessibility** - Use automated and manual testing

### For Designers
1. **Design with components** - Use established patterns
2. **Document deviations** - Explain why custom solutions are needed
3. **Consider all states** - Empty, loading, error, success
4. **Think systematically** - How does this scale?
5. **Collaborate early** - Involve developers in design decisions
