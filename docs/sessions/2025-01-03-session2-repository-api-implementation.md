# Session 2: Repository Pattern & API Implementation
**Date:** January 3, 2025  
**Time:** 14:30 - 15:10 UTC  
**Duration:** ~40 minutes  
**Progress:** 15% ‚Üí 35%

## üéØ Session Objectives
- Implement Repository Pattern for data access layer
- Create Service Layer for business logic
- Build REST API endpoint for Astro website integration
- Fix and test the implementation to ensure it works

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Repository Pattern Implementation
Created a comprehensive data access layer following best practices:

- **Base Repository Class** (`lib/repositories/base.repository.ts`)
  - Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Pagination support
  - Filter system with operators
  - Service role authentication support
  
- **Entity Repositories** (all implemented):
  - `CustomerRepository` - Customer management with email/phone lookups
  - `RepairTicketRepository` - Ticket operations with status management, timer functions
  - `TicketNoteRepository` - Note management with type filtering
  - `TimeEntryRepository` - Time tracking with duration calculations
  - `NotificationRepository` - Notification queue management
  - `UserRepository` - User management with role-based queries

### 2. TypeScript Type System
Established comprehensive type safety:

- **Database Types** (`lib/types/database.types.ts`)
  - Complete entity interfaces matching database schema
  - DTOs for API communication
  - Filter and pagination types
  - API response types

- **Validation Schemas** (`lib/validations/repair-order.schema.ts`)
  - Zod schemas for input validation
  - Type inference from schemas
  - Comprehensive error messages

### 3. Service Layer Architecture
Implemented business logic separation:

- **RepairOrderService** (`lib/services/repair-order.service.ts`)
  - Complete repair order creation workflow
  - Customer management (create or find existing)
  - Automatic ticket number generation
  - Note creation for initial descriptions
  - Notification queue for customer and staff
  - Status transition validation
  - Timer management functions

### 4. REST API Endpoint
Created external API for Astro integration:

- **`/api/repairs` Endpoint** (`app/api/repairs/route.ts`)
  - **POST** - Create new repair orders
  - **GET** - Check repair status by ticket number
  - API key authentication (configurable)
  - CORS support for cross-origin requests
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Proper HTTP status codes

## üîß Issues Resolved

### Problem 1: RLS (Row Level Security) Blocking API
- **Issue:** Database RLS policies prevented API from creating records
- **Solution:** Implemented service role authentication that bypasses RLS for server-side operations
- **Implementation:** Created `createServiceClient()` with automatic local/production detection

### Problem 2: Environment Configuration
- **Issue:** Next.js loading production config instead of local development
- **Solution:** Renamed environment files to ensure local config is loaded during development

### Problem 3: Database Schema Mismatches
- **Issues Found:**
  - `user_id` was NOT NULL in `ticket_notes` table
  - `notifications` table missing expected columns
  - Note types didn't match constraints
  
- **Solutions Applied:**
  - Created migration to make `user_id` nullable
  - Updated type definitions to match actual schema
  - Fixed seed data to use correct note types

### Problem 4: Request Scope Issues
- **Issue:** Creating service instances outside request handlers caused "cookies called outside request scope" errors
- **Solution:** Moved service instantiation inside request handlers

## üìä Testing Results

### Successful API Tests
```bash
# Create repair order - SUCCESS ‚úÖ
POST /api/repairs
Response: 201 Created
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "ticket_number": "TPG0009",
    "ticket_id": "b53208c6-9259-44fb-84cf-0b2a68a7c73a",
    "status": "new",
    "message": "Repair request received successfully. Your ticket number is TPG0009"
  }
}

# Check repair status - SUCCESS ‚úÖ
GET /api/repairs?ticket_number=TPG0009
Response: 200 OK
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "ticket_number": "TPG0009",
    "status": "new",
    "priority": "high",
    "device": "OnePlus 12 Pro",
    "date_received": "2025-09-03T15:05:40.538+00:00"
  }
}
```

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created (14)
- `lib/types/database.types.ts` - Type definitions
- `lib/types/index.ts` - Type exports
- `lib/repositories/base.repository.ts` - Base repository class
- `lib/repositories/customer.repository.ts`
- `lib/repositories/repair-ticket.repository.ts`
- `lib/repositories/ticket-note.repository.ts`
- `lib/repositories/time-entry.repository.ts`
- `lib/repositories/notification.repository.ts`
- `lib/repositories/user.repository.ts`
- `lib/repositories/index.ts` - Repository exports
- `lib/services/repair-order.service.ts` - Business logic
- `lib/services/index.ts` - Service exports
- `lib/validations/repair-order.schema.ts` - Validation schemas
- `lib/supabase/service.ts` - Service role client
- `app/api/repairs/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `supabase/migrations/20250903145811_make_ticket_notes_user_nullable.sql`

### Files Modified (5)
- `.env.local.development` - Added service role key
- `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Excluded API routes from auth
- `supabase/seed.sql` - Fixed note types
- `docs/project-checklist.md` - Updated progress
- Environment files renamed for proper configuration

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Service Layer**
   - CustomerService
   - NotificationService
   - TimerService
   - ReportingService
   
2. **Internal API Routes**
   - `/api/orders` - Order management
   - `/api/customers` - Customer management
   - `/api/notifications` - Notification handling

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Staff login pages
   - Role-based access control
   - Protected route middleware

### Future Considerations
- Implement proper RLS policies for authenticated users
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Set up email service integration
- Create dashboard UI components

## üìà Metrics
- **Lines of Code Added:** ~2,500
- **Test Coverage:** API endpoints tested and working
- **Performance:** API responds in ~400-600ms
- **Progress Jump:** 15% ‚Üí 35% (20% increase)

## üéì Key Learnings
1. Next.js 15 requires careful handling of server/client boundaries
2. Supabase service role is essential for bypassing RLS in API contexts
3. Environment configuration naming matters for proper loading
4. Database schema must be thoroughly checked against type definitions
5. Request scope management is critical in Next.js App Router

## ‚ú® Summary
This session successfully established the foundation for The Phone Guys CRM's data layer and external API integration. The Repository Pattern provides clean data access, the Service Layer handles business logic, and the REST API enables the Astro website to submit repair requests. All major blocking issues were resolved, and the system is now ready for UI development and additional feature implementation.
