- ✅ **Updated DeviceImageUploadDialog** with comprehensive options
- ✅ Added ability to select from gallery, upload new, or enter URL

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ Added missing shadcn/ui components (scroll-area, tabs)
- ✅ Fixed Next.js Image hostname configuration issues
- ✅ Replaced Next.js Image with regular img tags for gallery
- ✅ Enhanced visual consistency across image displays

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Server Actions Implementation
```typescript
// Fetch media gallery with search
async function fetchMediaGallery(searchTerm: string = '', limit: number = 50)

// Upload image and assign to device
async function uploadDeviceImage(formData: FormData)

// Select existing image from gallery
async function selectDeviceImage(deviceId: string, imageUrl: string)

// Remove device image
async function removeDeviceImage(deviceId: string)

// Upload to gallery without device assignment
async function uploadToGallery(file: File)
```

### Repository Pattern Consistency
- Used DeviceRepository for all database operations
- Used DeviceImageService for Supabase Storage operations
- Maintained clean separation of concerns
- Avoided API endpoints in favor of server actions

### Component Architecture
- **DeviceImageSelector**: Reusable image selection component
- **DeviceImageUploadDialog**: Comprehensive upload dialog for existing devices
- **DeviceDialog**: Enhanced device creation with image selection
- **Media Gallery**: Searchable image browser with pagination

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **Add Device to Profile Server Action Error**
   - Problem: Generic error messages without proper debugging
   - Solution: Enhanced logging and validation in server actions

2. **Next.js Image Hostname Configuration**
   - Problem: Local Supabase URLs not allowed in next/image
   - Solution: Updated next.config.ts and used regular img tags for gallery

3. **Missing UI Components**
   - Problem: scroll-area and tabs components not installed
   - Solution: Installed Radix UI dependencies and created components

4. **revalidatePath Import Error**
   - Problem: Importing from wrong module in Next.js 15
   - Solution: Changed import from "next/navigation" to "next/cache"

## 📝 Key Code Components

### DeviceImageSelector Component
```typescript
interface DeviceImageSelectorProps {
  selectedImageUrl?: string;
  onImageSelect: (imageUrl: string | null) => void;
  fetchMediaGallery: (searchTerm?: string, limit?: number) => Promise<any>;
  uploadToGallery?: (file: File) => Promise<{ success: boolean; data?: { url: string }; error?: string }>;
  trigger?: React.ReactNode;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

### Enhanced Device Dialog Integration
```typescript
<DeviceImageSelector
  selectedImageUrl={field.value}
  onImageSelect={(url) => field.onChange(url || "")}
  fetchMediaGallery={fetchMediaGallery}
  uploadToGallery={uploadToGallery}
  disabled={isLoading}
/>
```

### Next.js Configuration for Images
```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'http',
        hostname: '127.0.0.1',
        port: '54321',
        pathname: '/storage/v1/object/public/**',
      },
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: '*.supabase.co',
        pathname: '/storage/v1/object/public/**',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## 📊 Project Impact

### Features Added
- Complete device image lifecycle management
- Gallery-based image selection with search
- Image upload with validation and preview
- Reusable image selector component
- Enhanced device creation workflow
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Database Integration
- Seamless integration with existing device repository
- Proper image URL storage and retrieval
- Support for both image_url and thumbnail_url fields
