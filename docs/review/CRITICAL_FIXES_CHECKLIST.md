## 🛠️ Implementation Commands

### Quick Commands for Common Tasks

```bash
# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit --strict

# Find any types
grep -r ": any" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" lib/ app/ components/

# Run specific tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="repair-order"

# Check bundle size
npm run analyze

# Generate database types

## 📝 Notes & Blockers

### Known Blockers
- Email service requires SMTP configuration
- Rate limiting needs Redis setup (consider in-memory for MVP)
- Some tests may require database mocking

### Dependencies
- Email: Consider using Resend or SendGrid
- Rate Limiting: express-rate-limit or custom implementation
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library already configured

### Risk Mitigation
- Deploy with email disabled if not ready
- Use feature flags for partial rollouts
- Keep old code as backup during refactoring
- Test in staging environment first
